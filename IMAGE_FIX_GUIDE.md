# Image Loading Fix Guide

## Current Issue
The AI cartoon face image is not loading because the app is trying to use Vercel Blob storage but the environment variables are not configured.

## Quick Fix (Immediate)
I've added a temporary fallback that shows "AI" in a purple gradient circle. This will work immediately.

## Permanent Fix (Choose One)

### Option 1: Use Local Images (Simplest)
1. Uncomment the original image code in `src/app/page.tsx`
2. Comment out the fallback div
3. The image will load from the local `/public/` directory

### Option 2: Configure Vercel Blob Storage (Recommended for Production)

#### Step 1: Get Your Blob Store URL
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to Storage → Blob
3. Find your store ID in the URL or settings
4. Your blob store URL format: `https://{store-id}.public.blob.vercel-storage.com`

#### Step 2: Set Environment Variables
**For Local Development (.env.local):**
```bash
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_rw_your_token_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOB_STORE_URL=https://your-store-id.public.blob.vercel-storage.com
```

**For Vercel Production:**
1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Add these environment variables:
   - `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` = your blob token
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOB_STORE_URL` = your blob store URL

#### Step 3: Upload the Image
Run this command to upload the image to blob storage:
```bash
node scripts/upload-image.js
```

#### Step 4: Restore Original Image
1. Uncomment the original image code in `src/app/page.tsx`
2. Comment out the fallback div

## Test Your Setup
Run the blob token test:
```bash
node scripts/test-blob-token.js
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Temporary fallback working
- ⏳ Waiting for blob storage configuration
- ⏳ Image upload to blob storage needed

## Files Modified
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Added temporary fallback
- `src/lib/utils.ts` - Improved error handling
- `next.config.ts` - Added blob storage image domains
