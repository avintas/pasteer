# Image Loading Fix Guide

## Current Issue
The AI cartoon face image is not loading because the app is trying to use Vercel Blob storage but the environment variables are not configured.

## âœ… **RESOLVED!**
The image is now loading correctly from Vercel Blob storage at:
`https://nqezafsao1noacy7.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/ai_cartoon_face.jpg`

## Environment Variables Required

### For Vercel Blob Storage (Production)
**Only one environment variable is required:**
```bash
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_rw_your_token_here
```

### For Local Development (.env.local)
```bash
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_rw_your_token_here
```

## Important Notes

### âœ… **What's Working Now:**
- Image is served from Vercel Blob storage
- Public access is properly configured
- Next.js Image component is optimized
- No additional environment variables needed

### ðŸ”§ **Optional Environment Variables:**
If you want to use the unified image URL function, you can optionally set:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOB_STORE_URL=https://nqezafsao1noacy7.public.blob.vercel-storage.com
```

But this is **not required** - the image works fine without it.

## Verification

### Test Blob Storage
```bash
node scripts/test-blob-token.js
```

### Verify Image Accessibility
```bash
node scripts/verify-blob-image.js
```

## Current Status
- âœ… **Image loading correctly** from blob storage
- âœ… **BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN** configured
- âœ… **Public access** enabled
- âœ… **Optimized loading** with Next.js Image component

## Files Modified
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Using direct blob storage URL
- `src/lib/utils.ts` - Updated with fallback blob URL
- `next.config.ts` - Added blob storage image domains
- `scripts/verify-blob-image.js` - Verification script
